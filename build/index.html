  <p>Hello,</p>

  <p>I am Nathan Langley and I am a designer based in the North of England close to the great city of Manchester.</p>

  <p>Having been raised in the rolling hills outside of the London Sprawl, I have been drawn to the Post-Industrial city by its architecture, craggy horizons and industrious spirit.</p>

  <p>I call myself a designer but I have worn many hats. I've made websites, created brands and helped shape experiences. Yet all this amounts to taking due course in how a user experiences an object; striving for the simplest and cleanest approach.</p>

  <p>Currently I am Design Lead at <a href="https://evermix.fm" target="blank">Evermix</a>, a start up based in the Northern Quarter of Manchester that helps create memorable experiences for dance music afficiandos, clubbers and DJs alike.</p>

  <p class="italic">Q. Wheres the work?</p>

  <p>A. Yes, fair point. No work or words here yet, but there will be. In the meantime check out <a href="https://dribbble.com/_digin8" target="blank">my dribbble account</a> to see some fun stuff I've been working on.</p>
